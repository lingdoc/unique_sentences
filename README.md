# Are most sentences unique?

This repository contains code to get counts of unique sentences in corpora, based on 
corpora available in the NLTK library, as well as the well-known British National Corpus 
and the CHILDES corpus. English is the current language under investigation. This code
is used in the paper ["Are most sentences unique? An empirical examination of Chomskyan claims"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19108).
